## Indicator Defanger & Refanger

Welcome to the website for the Indicator Defanger and Refanger. We're standardizing the way [indicators of compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_of_compromise) are defanged (and refanged) to make the internet a safer place by:

1. Making sure indicators are properly and fully defanged so malicious links are not accidentally distributed.
2. Making it easy for automated scripts to refang indicators so that security professionals can collect and investigate data easily.
