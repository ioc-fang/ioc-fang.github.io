# IOC Fang: Indicator of Compromise (De)Fanging Project

Welcome to the website for fanging and defanging indicators of compromise. We're standardizing the way [indicators of compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_of_compromise) are fanged (and defanged) to make the internet a safer place by:

1. Making sure indicators are properly and fully defanged so malicious links are not accidentally distributed.
2. Making it easy for automated scripts to fang indicators so that security professionals can collect and investigate data easily.

## What is an Indicator of Compromise?

Indicators of compromise (IOCs) are “pieces of forensic data, such as data found in system log entries or files, that identify potentially malicious activity on a system or network.” Indicators of compromise aid information security and IT professionals in detecting data breaches, malware infections, or other threat activity. By monitoring for indicators of compromise, organizations can detect attacks and act quickly to prevent breaches from occurring or limit damages by stopping attacks in earlier stages.
