# IOC Fang: Indicator of Compromise (De)Fanging Project

Welcome to the website for fanging and defanging indicators of compromise. We're standardizing the way [indicators of compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_of_compromise) are fanged (and defanged) to make the internet a safer place by:

1. Making sure indicators are properly and fully defanged so malicious links are not accidentally distributed.
2. Making it easy for automated scripts to fang indicators so that security professionals can collect and investigate data easily.
